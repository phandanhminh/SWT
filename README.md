## Project Objective:
Develop a comprehensive software solution for jewelry processing companies to streamline customer order management. The software will include features to:
1. Introduce the company, showcase jewellery collections, designs, and share a blog.

2. Allow customers to order jewelry processing based on company designs or custom design requirements.

3. Manage the entire order process:
  Customer request submission
  Sales staff communication
  Price approval workflow (Sales staff → Manager → Sales staff → Customer)
  Order creation
  3D design submission and approval
  Jewellery processing
  Final delivery and warranty documentation

4. Update and calculate order costs based on:
  + Current gold price
  + Product weight
  + Labor wages
  + Stone costs

5. Declare payment policies, processing orders, gold prices, stone prices, and design model costs.

6. Provide a dashboard for statistical analysis and reporting.

This software aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction in jewelry order management.
